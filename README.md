# Enhanced Reverse Beacon Network: rbn

The **rbn** package provides an enhanced Reverse Beacon Network (RBN)
client that adds some useful features to the standard RBN
functionality. 

This repository is the source code respository. The *compiled*
application is contained in the **k6zx-rbnapp* repository.

## General Info

The RBN is a network of receiving stations listening to the amateur
bands and reporting what stations they hear transmitting. This
information is transmitted from the listening stations to a server
from which amateur radio operators can access these spot reports to
see who is operating on which frequencies, which operating modes, CW
speed, and the received signal strength from those stations at the
receiving stations. This allows one to see who is receiving your
transmissions and how well you are being heard. It also can show who
in your geographical area is being heard and by whom. 

The RBN has a web interface that one uses a browser to access and it
also has a telnet interface that allows for maximum throughput of the
spot data. RBN has two telnet access ports, one for CW, RTTY, and PSK
spots and another dedicated to FT8. It is the CW telnet interface that
the **rbn** package uses and then filtering of the spots is performed
as specified by the user's configuration. Access to FT8 spots is not
implemented. 

The **rbn** package allows one to connect to the RBN telnet stream and
filter the spots in many ways under the control of the user. Spots
that pass the filters and are displayed can be color-coded if the
station spotted is a member of a club (LICW and SKCC are currently
implemented). There is also a distance value that shows the location
of spotted station and the distance from that station to the user's
location. This is the added functionality provided by the **rbn**
package over and above what is available from RBN. 

This repository contains the source code of the **rbn** package. It
has been tested on the following operating systems:

- Linux

*Note: Testing on MacOS and Windows 10 is planned for the future.*

## Installation

The **rbn** package is implemented in Python and requires python 3. It
can be executed from source code in the manner of any python script
but the easiest method of deployment and execution is to use the
**rbnapp** package that is single file executable for all supported
operating systems. **rbnapp** is packaged separately and should be
accessed from that repository. 

For those knowledgeable/interested users, **rbn** may be executed from
source as follows. It is developed/tested on a Linux OS using the
Python Version Management Tool,
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), and creating a python
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
(i.e. python -m venv venv). The python interpreter and required python
modules are installed in the local virtual environment. In this way
the entire required python support system is available locally. The
required python modules are identified in the file 'requirements.txt'
and are installed in the local virtual environment using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt*. 

It would also be possible to use the python interpreter and required
packages installed on the system. This must be a python 3 version,
python 2 is not supported. The additional python packages will need to
be installed also using the package management system of the OS in
question. 

The **rbn** package runs in a terminal session and is invoked from the
command line. Its operation is configured with either a configuration
file or optional command line arguments. While either way is
effective, using a configuration file is probably the easiest method
of use. A default configuration file can be written using:

    rbn.py --init <config_dir>

 where *config_dir* is a directory in which the program's
 configuration file is stored.

## Invocation

The **rbn** package is invoked as follows:

```
usage: rbn.py [-h] [--init INIT] [-b BAND] [-c CALLSIGN] [-l LOGGING] [--telnetdebug TELNETDEBUG]
              [--de_maid DEMAID] [--dx_maid DXMAID] [--de_ituzone DEITUZONE] [--dx_ituzone DXITUZONE]
              [--de_cqzone DECQZONE] [--dx_cqzone DXCQZONE] [--min_wpm MINWPM] [--max_wpm MAXWPM]
              [-m MODE] [-f CONFIGFILE] [--licw-file LICWFILE] [--cwops CWOPS] [--skcc-file SKCCFILE]
              [--qrz_username QRZUSERNAME] [--qrz_password QRZPASSWORD] [--latitude LATITUDE]
              [--longitude LONGITUDE] [--skcc] [--licw]

RBN spot filter program. Args that start with '--' (eg. --init) can also be set in a config file
(specified via -f). Config file syntax allows: key=value, flag=true, stuff=[a,b,c] (for details, see
syntax at https://goo.gl/R74nmi). If an arg is specified in more than one place, then commandline
values override config file values which override defaults.

optional arguments:  
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  
  --init INIT           Initialize rbn configuration files  
  -b BAND, --band BAND  Display stations only on these bands  
  -c CALLSIGN, --callsign CALLSIGN  
                        Specify user's callsign  
  -l LOGGING, --logging LOGGING  
                        Enable program logging  
  --telnetdebug TELNETDEBUG

  --cwops CWOPS         CWOps Callsign file  
  --skcc-file SKCCFILE  SKCCLogger local membership database  
  --qrz_username QRZUSERNAME  
                        QRZ username

  --licw                Highlight LICW members  

Telnet to Reverse Beacon Network (RBN) server and capture CW spots. This program provides better
(IMHO) filtering of these spots. Provide the filtering parameters as command line arguments or in a
config file.
